=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: YouTube Transcript Extractor - Batch Processing Feature
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/004-batch-processing-for-playlists-video-lists
Started: 2026-01-02

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Net-new capability that extends single-video extraction to batch operations with playlist support, file input, parallel execution, and comprehensive progress tracking. Preserves backward compatibility while adding significant new functionality.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 7
- Total subtasks: 21
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json with reusable patterns

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Dependencies Setup): 2 subtasks - Add pytubefix and tqdm dependencies
- Phase 2 (Input Mode Implementation): 4 subtasks - Implement playlist, file, and multi-argument input modes
- Phase 3 (Batch Processing Core): 3 subtasks - ThreadPoolExecutor, error isolation, parallel flag
- Phase 4 (Progress Tracking): 3 subtasks - Dual-level progress bars with tqdm
- Phase 5 (Skip Processed Feature): 2 subtasks - State persistence with .processed_videos.txt
- Phase 6 (Summary Reporting): 2 subtasks - Error aggregation and summary formatter
- Phase 7 (Integration & Testing): 5 subtasks - E2E verification of all workflows

Services Involved:
- main (Python CLI): Single-file tool, all batch processing logic

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 4 (phases 4 & 5 can run together)
- Recommended workers: 1
- Sequential execution recommended due to logical dependencies within phases

Key Implementation Patterns Identified:
- Video ID extraction (lines 27-44): Reuse for all input modes
- Error handling (lines 46-66): Return dict pattern, apply to each video
- Argparse structure (lines 123-147): Extend with mutually exclusive groups
- File writing (lines 77-119): Use for skip-processed tracking
- Emoji status messages: Maintain consistency (✅, ❌, 🎥, 📋)

Technical Decisions:
- ThreadPoolExecutor (not ProcessPoolExecutor) for I/O-bound workload
- pytubefix (not pytube) - pytube is abandoned
- tqdm for nested progress bars
- Default 3 workers to avoid YouTube rate limiting
- Simple .processed_videos.txt file (no database)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 004 --parallel 1

Example:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 004 --parallel 1
